# Colab for the RL tutorial at M2L 2021

**Authors**: Feryal Behbahani and Gheorghe Comanici for [EEML 2020](https://github.com/eemlcommunity/PracticalSessions2020/tree/master/rl), adapted by Adrià Puigdomènech Badia and Bojan Vujatovic

**Description**: The tutorial covers a number of important reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, including multi-armed bandits, policy iteration, Q-Learning and deep RL. In the first part, we will guide you through the general interaction between RL agents and environments, where the agents ought to take actions in order to maximize returns (i.e. cumulative reward) in the simple multi-armed bandit setting. Next, we will implement Policy Iteration, SARSA, and Q-Learning for a simple tabular environment. The core ideas in the latter will be scaled to more complex MDPs through the use of function approximation. Lastly, we will provide a short introduction to deep reinforcement learning and the DQN algorithm.
